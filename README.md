<h1>Jump Jump!</h1>
<i>An endless runner where you have to jump to score as many points as you can!</i>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>My first game using Unity where my main goal was to get used to the Unity framework and C#.</p>

<p>After creating my first iteration of the game, I was given advice from industry professional during my work experience and refined 
the game to what it is now. </p>
<p>Making use of Unity Physics, I remodelled the interaction of objects using raycasts and spheres instead of 
  the provided physics callbacks. This allowed me to make the game more responsive and fixed issues I had with the scoring system previously. 
  I also made use of object pooling for optimisation to reduce garbage collection of game objects and the new input system so I could map both touchscreen and 
  keyboard controls at the same time using Input Actions.</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>There are still framerate issues with the game that can cause it to crash on certain devices
so in a future iteration, I would like to fix this.</p>
<p>The game is also very repetitive despite having randomly generating objects so to make the game more interesting, I would
like to create new levels with new mechanics (rope swinging, swimming etc.) to make the game more enjoyable.</p>
